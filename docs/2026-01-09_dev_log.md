# 2026-01-09 Development Summary

## Network & Infrastructure (Early Morning Session)
*   **Goal**: Enable seamless local network access for mobile testing.
*   **Key Changes**:
    *   **Auto-IP Detection**: Updated frontend `client.ts` to automatically use the local machine's IP address instead of `localhost`. This allows the frontend (running on a phone/emulator) to correctly communicate with the backend on the same LAN (Commit `f60e9c6`).

## Reminder System Refactor (Morning Session)
*   **Goal**: Improve the reliability and user experience of task reminders.
*   **Key Changes**:
    *   **DateTimePicker Overhaul**: Refactored `DateTimePicker.tsx` logic to better handle date selections and prevent invalid times.
    *   **Notification Logic**: Enhanced backend notification triggers in `main.py` and frontend handling in `Dashboard.tsx` to ensure reminders fire reliably at the correct time (Commit `038516c`).

## Document Editor Enhancements (Afternoon Session)
*   **Goal**: transform the note-taking experience with developer-focused features.
*   **Key Changes**:
    1.  **Advanced Code Blocks** (Commit `9c9307d`, `421f667`):
        *   **Multi-Language Support**: Integrated `lowlight` for syntax highlighting across 20+ languages (JS, Python, Rust, etc.).
        *   **Mermaid Diagrams**: Added native support for Mermaid.js. Writing `mermaid` code blocks now automatically renders interactive diagrams in Preview mode.
        *   **Unified Component**: Created `CodeBlockComponent` to manage state between raw code editing and visual preview.
        *   **UX Improvements**: Added a floating language selector and optimized styling to prevent dark-mode conflicts in diagrams.

    2.  **Fullscreen Editor** (Commit `973f224`):
        *   **Distraction-Free Mode**: Implemented a fullscreen toggle for the note editor.
        *   **Triple View Modes**:
            *   **Editor**: Dedicated coding/writing interface.
            *   **Preview**: Read-only rendering with diagram support.
            *   **Split**: Real-time side-by-side editing and previewing.
        *   **Consistent Layout**: Aligned fullscreen width (`max-w-5xl`) with the dashboard design for a cohesive visual experience.
